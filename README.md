# Ratings

A simple web user interface for displaying my personal ratings and notes for anime, movies, and television shows that I've watched. It's meant to be a quick, lightweight solution for viewing, sharing, and logging without having to rely on third-party websites. All data is stored in .xlsx files and read using the [SheetsJS](https://sheetjs.com/) library.

Developer Note:
For testing and to read .xlsx files locally, enter `about:config` in Firefox and temporarily set to false: `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy`
